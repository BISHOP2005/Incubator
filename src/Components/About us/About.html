    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    Founded with a vision to transform ideas into reality, dhaRti Foundation was established to support and nurture
    early-stage startups and innovations in the fields of technology, research, and development. The foundationâ€™s
    journey
    began at IIT Dharwad, a hub of technical excellence and research, where we identified the need for a structured
    environment that could support entrepreneurs and innovators in bringing their solutions to market. Since its
    inception
    in 2022, dhaRti has played a key role in bridging the gap between academia and industry by providing resources,
    mentorship, and strategic support to emerging companies.
    Today, dhaRti continues to be a dynamic incubator where ideas are nurtured, technologies are developed, and
    businesses
    are built. Through partnerships with academic institutions, corporate sponsors, and government bodies, we are
    creating
    an ecosystem that enables startups to grow, scale, and make a meaningful impact on society.
