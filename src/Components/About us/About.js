        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Founded with a vision to transform ideas into reality, dhaRti Foundation was established to support and nurture
          early-stage startups and innovations in the fields of technology, research, and development. The foundationâ€™s
          journey began at IIT Dharwad, a hub of technical excellence and research, where we identified the need for a
          structured environment that could support entrepreneurs and innovators in bringing their solutions to market.
          Since its inception in 2022, dhaRti has played a key role in bridging the gap between academia and industry by
          providing resources, mentorship, and strategic support to emerging companies. Today, dhaRti continues to be a
          dynamic incubator where ideas are nurtured, technologies are developed, and businesses are built. Through
          partnerships with academic institutions, corporate sponsors, and government bodies, we are creating an ecosystem
          that enables startups to grow, scale, and make a meaningful impact on society.
